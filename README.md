# MyReads Web Application

My reads is a web application, that allows user to search for books and to categorize them.
There are three categories or book shelves: Currently reading, Want to read and read.
User can add a book to a desired category on the main page as well as on the search page.

## History

I've written this project as a part of Front End Nanodegree program at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).
The project is based on **React** and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
I've coded and designed the project from the scratch. Backend server and `BooksAPI.js` are provided by Udacity.

## Features:

+ On the main page user sees three shelves and books, that are assigned to them.
+ User can change a book category on any page, anytime.
+ User can freely navigate from main page to the search page and back using interface  or _forward_ and _back_ buttons of a browser.
+ Every book is being displayed with a thumbnail, title and authors, if the information is available on the server.
+ If there are no search results on the search page, a small, delicate message is being shown.
+ All pages are completely flexible across all known screen sizes.
+ Smooth flow and elegance are ought to create a perfect user experience.
